I am a final-year electrical and electronics engineering student and an aspiring data analyst. I'm currently expanding my knowledge into Python, SQL, Machine learning, and data analysis. I am passionate about building innovative and useful analytical projects, and always looking to learn new skills and take on challenges.

On this profile, you will find a selection of my personal and professional projects. Each project has its readme with detailed information and instructions on how to run and use the code.

Please feel free to take a look around and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.

**Thank you for visiting my profile :rocket:**
